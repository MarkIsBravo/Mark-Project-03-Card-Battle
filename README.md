Team 4 Proposal Card-Battle Members (Dan Martin, Carly Warner, Ryan Edwards, MarkMarkMark)

User Story Card-Battle (temporary basic name) 'Card Battle' is a game app where players can face off against their friends in a battle type style. There will be a register and login option upon the website loading, with implementation of auth and conditionals to determine which options to display across the different pages, along with a logout option once a user has logged in.

Once a user has either registerd an account or logged in to a previously created account, they are redirected to the home page. On this home page, there is a deck of 50 cards, and users are dealt 10 cards randomly from the deck. The deck is full of cards with different stats for health and defense. Once both users have been dealt their cards (at this point only the user can see their own cards).

To play, users will get a randomly generated 5 cards from their user deck. Upon both users receiving their 5 to play, they face each other head to head. When they are playing against each other, they are then able to see the 5 cards they have been dealt, and select which card to play for each matchup.

Users are given a set number of health before they face off, and depending on what cards they play will determine how much health they lose (cards having stats of attack/defense).

Winner will be determined by who has the most health remaining after the round.
